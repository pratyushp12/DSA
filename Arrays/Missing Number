Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Brute : Linear Search - O(n^2)
Better : Array.sort or map - o(NlogN) - JS engine internally uses quicksort
optimal : sum or Xor(xor of same element is 0 and xor of 0 with a num is num)
