Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
 
Approach 1: Sort and then traverse the array to checkthe next ele greater than the current and maintain count
TC: O(NlogN)+O(N)
Extra SC: O(1)

Approach 2: use map to store all the elements and for each ele check if smaller is in map, if yes then increment the i else suppose
this is the starting point and increment counter and check for next greater ele.

TC: O(N)+O(2N)
Extra SC: O(N)
